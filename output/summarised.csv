"Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the identical twin brother of the late president and leader of the country's main opposition party, Law and Justice, is boycotting the official memorial events.
His supporters are also planning to gather outside the presidential palace to remember the victims and vent their anger against the Russians and the government for their handling of the crash investigation.
For a brief time the tragedy united the country in shock, at first, and then mourning for the victims.
Thousands came from all over the country to place flowers and candles in front of the presidential palace. They did so even if they opposed Lech Kaczynski's policies.
It was the nation's worst disaster since World War Two. Apart from the president and his wife, Maria, the crash claimed the lives of the commanders of the armed forces, the heads of the National Bank and Olympic Committee, and politicians from all parties.
The location of the disaster was hugely symbolic too. The delegation was on its way to attend a 70th anniversary ceremony of the Katyn massacre, one of Poland's most painful wartime events in which more than 20,000 Polish officers, the country's elite, were murdered on Stalin's orders.
It is perhaps not surprising that the unity did not last long. Lech Kaczynski was a divisive figure and many Poles disliked his nationalism and combative relations with Germany and Russia.
Divisions arose within days when it was announced that Lech Kaczynski and his wife would be buried among Poland's kings at Krakow's Wawel Cathedral. Many Poles felt the location was inappropriate.
Over the course of the year the tragedy has been used instrumentally by politicians here.
Clearly devastated by the death of his twin, sister-in-law, and many close friends and colleagues, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a more aggressive and nationalist politician than his brother, has made the crash, and the investigation into it, the central issue for his party.
The investigation was carried out by the Russians because the crash happened at Smolensk military airfield near Katyn.
In January, the Russian investigation released its final report and found that the immediate cause of the crash was the pilots' decision to attempt to land despite extremely poor visibility caused by dense fog at the airfield.
The report also concluded that the pilots were put under pressure to attempt the landing because they expected a negative reaction from Lech Kaczynski if they decided to fly to a reserve airport with better weather conditions. That would have considerably delayed the delegation on its way to the Katyn memorial service.
The Polish government accepted the report's main findings but criticised the Russians for failing to investigate its own role in the tragedy, namely the actions of the air traffic controllers at Smolensk.
It was notable however that both countries' foreign ministers stressed that it would not derail the hitherto successful attempts to normalise relations.
But the fact that the investigation was seen by many here as being neither comprehensive nor fair raised old suspicions about the Russians.
It has also added fuel to conspiracy theories - such as that the Russians artificially created the fog to bring the plane down.
The majority of people here do not believe in those conspiracies, but an opinion poll this week found that 78% of respondents reckon the circumstances of the crash have not been fully cleared up.
Poland has yet to complete its own investigation into the disaster.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski does not accept the findings of the investigation. He has accused the government of ""servility"" towards the Russians who, he says, ""bear direct responsibility for the crash"".
He has said that it was Moscow which took the decision to allow the plane to land in such poor weather not the air traffic controllers.
The media has also played an important role over the year. With 24-hour rolling news and so much air time to fill barely a day goes by without a mention of the crash and some new development.
A recent survey said 78% of Poles were bored and irritated of hearing about it all the time. A group of students started a campaign on the social networking site Facebook to have one full day without mentioning the disaster.
The poll also found that 87% believed the crash was being used as a political tool.

The article discusses the upcoming anniversary of the Smolensk plane crash that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski and many other high-ranking officials in 2010. The crash was a national tragedy that initially united the country in shock and mourning, but divisions soon emerged. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the president's identical twin brother and leader of the opposition party Law and Justice, is boycotting the official memorial events and instead planning to gather with supporters outside the presidential palace to remember the victims and express anger towards the Russians and the government for their handling of the crash investigation.

The investigation, led by the Russians, concluded that the pilots' decision to attempt to land in poor visibility was the main cause of the crash. However, the Polish government criticized the report for not fully investigating the role of Russian air traffic controllers. Jaroslaw Kaczynski has accused the government of being too soft on Russia and has claimed that Moscow bears direct responsibility for the crash.

The crash has been used as a political tool by politicians, with Jaroslaw Kaczynski making it a central issue for his party. The media has also played a significant role, with many Poles feeling that the crash is being over-covered and used to distract from other issues.

In January, the Russian investigation released its final report and found that the immediate cause of the crash was the pilots' decision to attempt to land despite extremely poor visibility caused by dense fog at the airfield.
The report also concluded that the pilots were put under pressure to attempt the landing because they expected a negative reaction from Lech Kaczynski if they decided to fly to a reserve airport with better weather conditions. That would have considerably delayed the delegation on its way to the Katyn memorial service.
The Polish government accepted the report's main findings but criticised the Russians for failing to investigate its own role in the tragedy, namely the actions of the air traffic controllers at Smolensk.

Here's a summary of the article:

It's been a year since the plane crash in Smolensk, Russia, that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife, and 94 others. The crash was a national tragedy that initially united Poland in shock and mourning. However, the unity was short-lived due to political divisions and controversy surrounding the investigation.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the president's twin brother and leader of the opposition party Law and Justice, is boycotting official memorial events and instead plans to hold a separate gathering outside the presidential palace to remember the victims and express anger towards the Russian government and the Polish government's handling of the investigation.

The Russian investigation concluded that the crash was caused by the pilots' decision to land in poor visibility, but many Poles, including Jaroslaw Kaczynski, are skeptical of the findings and believe the Russians bear responsibility for the crash. Conspiracy theories, including the idea that the Russians created the fog to bring the plane down, have also gained traction.

The media has played a significant role in keeping the story in the public eye, but many Poles are growing tired of the constant coverage. A recent survey found that 78% of Poles are bored and irritated with the constant mentions of the crash, and 87% believe it's being used as a political tool.

Here's a summary of the article:

In the last Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) before the summer break, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the government of being out of touch with reality and criticized low pay for public servants. Prime Minister Theresa May responded by saying that her party values public services, but knows that they need to be paid for. Corbyn urged May to lift the cap on wage rises and cited the case of a nurse who has faced pay restraint for seven years. May recognized the sacrifices made by public servants, but accused Labour of making unfunded spending pledges. The exchange came amid reports of infighting within the Conservative party, with Chancellor Philip Hammond reportedly saying that public service workers are ""overpaid"". May has warned her party against ""backbiting"" and has urged ministers to accept collective responsibility. Some MPs have expressed support for May, with one senior backbencher saying she would have their backing if she sacked plotting ministers. Parliament will go into recess on Thursday and return on September 5.",566,206,772,5,0.5,0.5,Question,Correct Answers,document,,

Mrs May is seeking to restore order to her party following a series of leaks and negative briefings, with Chancellor Philip Hammond reported to have told a private cabinet meeting public service workers were ""overpaid"".
Mr Corbyn asked whether, given the ""squabbling"" inside government, Mr Hammond had been talking about Mrs May's ministers.

""I look along that front bench opposite and I see a cabinet bickering and backbiting while the economy gets weaker and people are pushed further into debt,"" he added.
Mrs May said she recognised the sacrifices made by public servants towards reducing the deficit. She said the Tories had a ""record to be proud of"" and accused Labour of unfunded spending pledges.
""The government doesn't seem to have any problem paying for DUP support,"" Mr Corbyn replied, in a reference to the Â£1bn package that secured the Democratic Unionist Party's backing for the Tories' minority administration.

Mrs May, under pressure since losing her Commons majority last month, has warned ministers and MPs that any ""backbiting"" between party figures could let Mr Corbyn into Downing Street.

BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was now ""something of a backlash"" from MPs towards the ""big beasts"" thought to be manoeuvring themselves behind the scenes to replace her.

Twitter is enabling companies to engage in a much warmer relationship with their clientele, but when things go wrong for the customer, it is also the best way to get grievances resolved quickly and in real time says comedian David Schneider, who is also a Twitter expert and runs social media consultancy That Lot.
""If you're 29th in the queue on a phone call, only you know that. It's you and the person who's keeping you on hold. But if you tweet, it's public and it could be picked up, and I think companies are very aware of that,"" says Mr Schneider.

A bad review or negative comment can be retweeted by millions, and companies are often keen to defuse customer anger very quickly in a public space such as Twitter. If it is done cleverly, it can even work in a company's favour.
""I remember there was a time where there was an outage on O2 on the network and they were getting a hell of a lot of bad press,"" says Mr Schneider. ""People were tweeting very aggressively at the O2 account and about O2 - it was trending.
""They happened to have a very skilful, self-deprecating, humorous person on their Twitter feed at that time who dealt with the abuse in a very amusing way.""
Mr Schneider says it was interesting to see a wave of criticism turn to positive comments from the customers.
When a complaint is treated with a personal touch, it can even go viral on Twitter. For instance one Argos customer service representative chose to reply to customer Immy ""Badman"" Bugti's complaint using the same street style he had used in his tweet.
A shortened version of the messages read: ""@Argos_online: Yo, wen you gettin' da ps4 tings in moss side? Ain't waitin' no more.""
""@BadManBugti: Safe Badman. We gettin' sum more PS4 tings in wivin da next week, y'get me.""
The company response from Argos was retweeted over 1,500 times within the space of a few hours.
Jo Causon, chief executive of the Institute of Customer Service, says consumers are becoming much more savvy and expect organisations to relate to them as real life human beings and not simply transactions any more.
""One of the key things that we're seeing in the changing world we're all living in is that we want to have better dialogue, not just monologue, with our organisations,"" says Ms Causon.
According to a poll of 2,000 people by the communications agency Fishburn Hedges and Echo Research in April 2012, 36% of people had used a social media platform to contact a big company and 65% said it was a better way than call centres to get in touch with companies.
It was not just confined to the young either, with 27% of people aged over 55 having used social media to complain.
Ms Causon expects complaints via Twitter to only increase in popularity with the growth of social media.
""A lot of us at the moment are not complaining necessarily through Twitter, but as we progress, it certainly is a medium of choice, and organisations will need to be able to respond appropriately,"" says Ms Causon.
With almost 15,000 complaints a day about financial services in 2013, according to complaints data from the Financial Conduct Authority, Hannah Moore from BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme monitored the Twitter feeds of eight of the major banks for a working day and found problems were not necessarily resolved on Twitter, but it did help push requests to the front of the queue.
""When customers complained about hanging on premium rate phonelines, [some] staff promised to call them instead, and if you're confused about which department you need to get in touch with, Twitter's really helpful,"" she says.
""The best banks provided the correct phone numbers, forms and web links within minutes - again saving you time on an 0845 number.""
According to Ms Causon it's important for the consumer to be responsible about choosing the right channel for their complaint too.
""A banking problem in itself doesn't necessarily lend itself to a very public place like Twitter, so I think it's about the nature of the problem and what you're looking to have resolved.""
If Twitter is making it easier to complain, it also makes it easier for consumers to give positive feedback to companies too, so there is no danger we will turn into a nation of whingers.

""I remember there was a time where there was an outage on O2 on the network and they were getting a hell of a lot of bad press,"" says Mr Schneider. ""People were tweeting very aggressively at the O2 account and about O2 - it was trending.
""They happened to have a very skilful, self-deprecating, humorous person on their Twitter feed at that time who dealt with the abuse in a very amusing way.""
Mr Schneider says it was interesting to see a wave of criticism turn to positive comments from the customers.
When a complaint is treated with a personal touch, it can even go viral on Twitter. For instance one Argos customer service representative chose to reply to customer Immy ""Badman"" Bugti's complaint using the same street style he had used in his tweet.
A shortened version of the messages read: ""@Argos_online: Yo, wen you gettin' da ps4 tings in moss side? Ain't waitin' no more.""
""@BadManBugti: Safe Badman. We gettin' sum more PS4 tings in wivin da next week, y'get me.""
The company response from Argos was retweeted over 1,500 times within the space of a few hours.
Jo Causon, chief executive of the Institute of Customer Service, says consumers are becoming much more savvy and expect organisations to relate to them as real life human beings and not simply transactions any more.
""One of the key things that we're seeing in the changing world we're all living in is that we want to have better dialogue, not just monologue, with our organisations,"" says Ms Causon.
According to a poll of 2,000 people by the communications agency Fishburn Hedges and Echo Research in April 2012, 36% of people had used a social media platform to contact a big company and 65% said it was a better way than call centres to get in touch with companies.
It was not just confined to the young either, with 27% of people aged over 55 having used social media to complain.
Ms Causon expects complaints via Twitter to only increase in popularity with the growth of social media.
""A lot of us at the moment are not complaining necessarily through Twitter, but as we progress, it certainly is a medium of choice, and organisations will need to be able to respond appropriately,"" says Ms Causon.
With almost 15,000 complaints a day about financial services in 2013, according to complaints data from the Financial Conduct Authority, Hannah Moore from BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme monitored the Twitter feeds of eight of the major banks for a working day and found problems were not necessarily resolved on Twitter, but it did help push requests to the front of the queue.
""When customers complained about hanging on premium rate phonelines, [some] staff promised to call them instead, and if you're confused about which department you need to get in touch with, Twitter's really helpful,"" she says.
""The best banks provided the correct phone numbers, forms and web links within minutes - again saving you time on an 0845 number.""
According to Ms Causon it's important for the consumer to be responsible about choosing the right channel for their complaint too.
""A banking problem in itself doesn't necessarily lend itself to a very public place like Twitter, so I think it's about the nature of the problem and what you're looking to have resolved.""
If Twitter is making it easier to complain, it also makes it easier for consumers to give positive feedback to companies too, so there is no danger we will turn into a nation of whingers.

The article discusses how Twitter is changing the way companies interact with their customers, particularly when it comes to complaints and customer service. Here are the main points:

* Twitter allows customers to publicly express their grievances, which can prompt companies to respond quickly to resolve the issue and avoid negative publicity.
* Companies are aware that a bad review or negative comment can be retweeted by millions, so they're motivated to defuse customer anger quickly in a public space like Twitter.
* When done well, responding to customer complaints on Twitter can even work in a company's favor, as it shows they're listening and care about their customers.
* Examples of companies successfully handling customer complaints on Twitter include O2, which used humor to respond to angry customers during a network outage, and Argos, which replied to a customer's complaint in a playful, street-style tone that went viral.
* Consumers are becoming more savvy and expect companies to relate to them as human beings, not just transactions. They want better dialogue, not just monologue, with organizations.
* A poll found that 36% of people have used social media to contact a big company, and 65% said it was a better way than call centers to get in touch with companies.
* Complaints via Twitter are expected to increase in popularity with the growth of social media.
* While Twitter can be a useful channel for complaining, it's not always the best choice for every problem. Consumers should be responsible about choosing the right channel for their complaint.
* Twitter also makes it easier for consumers to give positive feedback to companies, so there's no danger of becoming a nation of whingers.",1006,330,1336,5,0.5,0.5,Question,Correct Answers,document,,
"When Angie Konrad tweeted that the heating was switched off on her train, she did not expect the operators of that line to read the message and alert the driver to switch the heating on so she could enjoy the rest of her journey in comfort.
Twitter is enabling companies to engage in a much warmer relationship with their clientele, but when things go wrong for the customer, it is also the best way to get grievances resolved quickly and in real time says comedian David Schneider, who is also a Twitter expert and runs social media consultancy That Lot.
""If you're 29th in the queue on a phone call, only you know that. It's you and the person who's keeping you on hold. But if you tweet, it's public and it could be picked up, and I think companies are very aware of that,"" says Mr Schneider.
