"The protests led to the departure of the country's former ruler, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, and sparked the wider Arab Spring across North Africa and the Middle East.
However, despite the removal of President Ben Ali, economic reforms in Tunisia since 2011 have stalled due to continuing political unrest, which dragged on until the end of last year.
Yet with a moderate, interim government of independent figures appointed in December, and the country's new constitution being agreed in January, there is now renewed optimism that pro-business changes will be forthcoming, to enable entrepreneurship and small businesses to flourish.
The sense of confidence has been strengthened by backing from the World Bank, which last month awarded Tunisia loans totalling $1.2bn (Â£719m) to help drive economic and political reform.
The World Bank said that this figure included $750m ""in support of government reforms to level the economic playing field and promote growth and job creation"", and $100m to increase lending to small and medium-sized companies.
For most Tunisian entrepreneurs, reforms to make their jobs easier cannot come quickly enough.
Ramzi el Fekih, 46, says the key to helping new businesses launch and grow in Tunisia is a better judicial system.
Mr el Fekih is chief executive of Viamobile, a mobile phone banking and payments app.
He launched the business in Tunisia in 2009 after returning to the country following 25 years working abroad, including 20 years in the mobile phone technology sector in California.
""The biggest difference between working here and in California is the lack of trust,"" says Mr el Fekih. ""People try to protect themselves, because they have been had before, but it becomes very constraining.""
""There is so much control, that we can't move, but what we need is a judicial system that punishes people who don't follow the law.""
Mr el Fekih says he would also like to see much less regulation and bureaucracy, complaining that it took him two years to get Viamobile approved by the country's central bank.
But despite his frustrations, he says he has no regrets about to returning to his homeland.
""I really believe that there is a huge potential in Tunisia and Tunisian entrepreneurs,"" he says.
Mr el Fekih is hoping that now, with the new constitution in place, the Tunisian state will move fast on reforms. His analogy is borrowed from the world of mobile technology.
""What politicians can do is design an easy and accessible operating system, so entrepreneurs can follow and create applications,"" he says. ""Now is the time.""
For fellow entrepreneur Zied Jallouli, 29, the big problem for start-ups in Tunisia is securing financial backing.
""Raising funds here for a big idea is really, really tough,"" says Mr Jallouli, shaking his head.
He and his business partner have created a smartphone app called Disrupt CK, which they claim can help people to buy clothes or other consumer goods similar to those they see in a film or TV show.
Mr Jallouli says you simply point your smartphone at the television, press the app button, and it will produce a list of suggested items.
While Mr Jallouli couldn't get a Tunisian bank or wealthy Tunisian investor to back him, he was ultimately able to secure investment from a Swedish ex-pat.
The Swede in question is Thomas Adner, a former executive for Swedish packaging giant Tetra Pak, who had been working in North Africa for eight years.
Mr Adner is so impressed with Mr Jallouli's product that he has even joined the company as its chief marketing officer.
""There are some great business opportunities in Tunisia,"" says Mr Adner, who points out the low cost of hiring well-trained web developers and programmers.
""You can run quite a few miles with the cash that you have,"" he says.
But Mr Adner still sees numerous hurdles to doing business in Tunisia that need removing.
""Back home [in Sweden] it takes about 30 minutes to register a new business, and in two days all the paperwork is done,"" he says.
""Tunisian authorities make it not only very difficult to start a company, it takes months if not longer. There is so much red tape here, for anyone who wants to start a business.
""The government really needs to make it easier to start a company.""
Laurent Gonnet, the World Bank's financial sector specialist in Tunisia, also agrees that much work needs to be done in the country to help businesses.
He says the country's commercial banks are ""extremely cautious and risk averse"", particularly when it comes to technology companies.
He adds that ""Tunisia is also one of the last countries that lack a private credit rating system"", making it even harder for entrepreneurs to convince banks to lend them money to back a business idea.
Thankfully, the country's politicians now seem committed to pro-business reform, no doubt spurred on by the World Bank, and a difficult economic backdrop, with unemployment at 16%.
The hope is that this commitment will not be curtailed by general elections due at the end of this year.
""We are reviewing the investment code in order to reduce red tape,"" says Dhamir Mannai, an assembly member from the CPR party of current President Moncef Marzouki.
Meanwhile, Moncef Cheikhrouhou, a member of the opposition Democratic Alliance, and the deputy chairman of the parliament's finance, planning and development committee, says that ""entrepreneurship is most needed to create wealth"".
""We are treating this as an urgent matter, and are looking for input from entrepreneurs as well,"" he says.","Three years ago thousands of Tunisians protested on the streets, demanding, among other things, more economic opportunity.",26336738,Claude 3 Haiku,anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0,"Here is a summary of the key points:

While Mr Jallouli couldn't get a Tunisian bank or wealthy Tunisian investor to back him, he was ultimately able to secure investment from a Swedish ex-pat.
The Swede in question is Thomas Adner, a former executive for Swedish packaging giant Tetra Pak, who had been working in North Africa for eight years.
Mr Adner is so impressed with Mr Jallouli's product that he has even joined the company as its chief marketing officer.
""There are some great business opportunities in Tunisia,"" says Mr Adner, who points out the low cost of hiring well-trained web developers and programmers.
""You can run quite a few miles with the cash that you have,"" he says.
But Mr Adner still sees numerous hurdles to doing business in Tunisia that need removing.
""Back home [in Sweden] it takes about 30 minutes to register a new business, and in two days all the paperwork is done,"" he says.
""Tunisian authorities make it not only very difficult to start a company, it takes months if not longer. There is so much red tape here, for anyone who wants to start a business.

Laurent Gonnet, the World Bank's financial sector specialist in Tunisia, also agrees that much work needs to be done in the country to help businesses.
He says the country's commercial banks are ""extremely cautious and risk averse"", particularly when it comes to technology companies.
He adds that ""Tunisia is also one of the last countries that lack a private credit rating system"", making it even harder for entrepreneurs to convince banks to lend them money to back a business idea.
Thankfully, the country's politicians now seem committed to pro-business reform, no doubt spurred on by the World Bank, and a difficult economic backdrop, with unemployment at 16%.
The hope is that this commitment will not be curtailed by general elections due at the end of this year.

Following the 2011 protests that ousted President Ben Ali and sparked the Arab Spring, Tunisia's economic reforms stalled due to political unrest. Recent developments have renewed optimism:

- A moderate interim government was appointed in December
- A new constitution was agreed in January
- The World Bank awarded $1.2bn in loans to support reforms

## Challenges for Entrepreneurs

Tunisian entrepreneurs face significant obstacles:

1. **Judicial system issues**: Lack of trust and excessive control hamper business operations
2. **Excessive bureaucracy**: Business approvals can take years
3. **Limited access to funding**: Banks are extremely risk-averse, especially for tech companies
4. **Red tape**: Business registration is time-consuming compared to other countries

## Political Response

Politicians now appear committed to pro-business reform, motivated by:
- World Bank support
- 16% unemployment rate
- Upcoming general elections

Yet with a moderate, interim government of independent figures appointed in December, and the country's new constitution being agreed in January, there is now renewed optimism that pro-business changes will be forthcoming, to enable entrepreneurship and small businesses to flourish.
The sense of confidence has been strengthened by backing from the World Bank, which last month awarded Tunisia loans totalling $1.2bn (Â£719m) to help drive economic and political reform.
The World Bank said that this figure included $750m ""in support of government reforms to level the economic playing field and promote growth and job creation"", and $100m to increase lending to small and medium-sized companies.
For most Tunisian entrepreneurs, reforms to make their jobs easier cannot come quickly enough.
Ramzi el Fekih, 46, says the key to helping new businesses launch and grow in Tunisia is a better judicial system.
Mr el Fekih is chief executive of Viamobile, a mobile phone banking and payments app.
He launched the business in Tunisia in 2009 after returning to the country following 25 years working abroad, including 20 years in the mobile phone technology sector in California.
""The biggest difference between working here and in California is the lack of trust,"" says Mr el Fekih. ""People try to protect themselves, because they have been had before, but it becomes very constraining.""
""There is so much control, that we can't move, but what we need is a judicial system that punishes people who don't follow the law.""
Mr el Fekih says he would also like to see much less regulation and bureaucracy, complaining that it took him two years to get Viamobile approved by the country's central bank.
But despite his frustrations, he says he has no regrets about to returning to his homeland.
""I really believe that there is a huge potential in Tunisia and Tunisian entrepreneurs,"" he says.
Mr el Fekih is hoping that now, with the new constitution in place, the Tunisian state will move fast on reforms. His analogy is borrowed from the world of mobile technology.
""What politicians can do is design an easy and accessible operating system, so entrepreneurs can follow and create applications,"" he says. ""Now is the time.""
For fellow entrepreneur Zied Jallouli, 29, the big problem for start-ups in Tunisia is securing financial backing.
""Raising funds here for a big idea is really, really tough,"" says Mr Jallouli, shaking his head.
He and his business partner have created a smartphone app called Disrupt CK, which they claim can help people to buy clothes or other consumer goods similar to those they see in a film or TV show.
Mr Jallouli says you simply point your smartphone at the television, press the app button, and it will produce a list of suggested items.
While Mr Jallouli couldn't get a Tunisian bank or wealthy Tunisian investor to back him, he was ultimately able to secure investment from a Swedish ex-pat.
The Swede in question is Thomas Adner, a former executive for Swedish packaging giant Tetra Pak, who had been working in North Africa for eight years.
Mr Adner is so impressed with Mr Jallouli's product that he has even joined the company as its chief marketing officer.
""There are some great business opportunities in Tunisia,"" says Mr Adner, who points out the low cost of hiring well-trained web developers and programmers.
""You can run quite a few miles with the cash that you have,"" he says.
But Mr Adner still sees numerous hurdles to doing business in Tunisia that need removing.
""Back home [in Sweden] it takes about 30 minutes to register a new business, and in two days all the paperwork is done,"" he says.
""Tunisian authorities make it not only very difficult to start a company, it takes months if not longer. There is so much red tape here, for anyone who wants to start a business.
""The government really needs to make it easier to start a company.""
Laurent Gonnet, the World Bank's financial sector specialist in Tunisia, also agrees that much work needs to be done in the country to help businesses.
He says the country's commercial banks are ""extremely cautious and risk averse"", particularly when it comes to technology companies.
He adds that ""Tunisia is also one of the last countries that lack a private credit rating system"", making it even harder for entrepreneurs to convince banks to lend them money to back a business idea.
Thankfully, the country's politicians now seem committed to pro-business reform, no doubt spurred on by the World Bank, and a difficult economic backdrop, with unemployment at 16%.
The hope is that this commitment will not be curtailed by general elections due at the end of this year.
""We are reviewing the investment code in order to reduce red tape,"" says Dhamir Mannai, an assembly member from the CPR party of current President Moncef Marzouki.
Meanwhile, Moncef Cheikhrouhou, a member of the opposition Democratic Alliance, and the deputy chairman of the parliament's finance, planning and development committee, says that ""entrepreneurship is most needed to create wealth"".
""We are treating this as an urgent matter, and are looking for input from entrepreneurs as well,"" he says.","Three years ago thousands of Tunisians protested on the streets, demanding, among other things, more economic opportunity.",26336738,Nova Pro,amazon.nova-pro-v1:0,"The protests in Tunisia led to the departure of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and sparked the Arab Spring.

England coach Eddie Jones has made several changes to the team for the first Test against Australia. Luther Burrell replaces George Ford at inside centre, with Owen Farrell moving to fly-half. Marland Yarde starts on the wing instead of Jack Nowell, who moves to the bench. Chris Robshaw returns to the blind-side flanker position after missing the Wales game.

The forward pack remains unchanged from the Six Nations finale against France, where England secured the Grand Slam with a 31-21 victory. Despite Ford missing six out of seven kicks in the warm-up match against Wales, and Farrell's excellent form with Saracens, Joe Launchbury must settle for a bench spot despite his man-of-the-match performance against Wales.

Captain Dylan Hartley expressed confidence, stating: ""We expect to win, we believe we can win, we are here to win."" England has historically struggled in Australia, winning only three of 17 Tests there and never securing a series victory.

Australia will field three debutants in their lineup as they prepare for what Jones describes as a ""physical battle"" in Brisbane.",912,258,1170,25,0.5,0.5,Question,Correct Answers,document,0.0,0.0,0.7428215781166648,0.7253929236028558,0.7521699096435678

England's captain, Dylan Hartley, expressed confidence in the team's ability to win, stating that they are there to secure victory. Despite England's impressive performance in the Six Nations, they have yet to win a Test series in Australia, having only won three out of 17 matches.

The team's selection reflects a focus on physical and aggressive play, as emphasized by Jones. The decision to start Burrell and Yarde, along with the inclusion of Robshaw, suggests a strategic approach to counter Australia's anticipated physicality. Notably, Owen Farrell has been chosen over George Ford at fly-half, likely due to Farrell's exceptional form and Ford's recent poor performance in goal-kicking.

Australia has also introduced three debutants to their lineup, aiming to strengthen their side for the series. The first Test is seen as crucial for both teams, with England emphasizing the need for a strong start.

The Ospreys scrum-half, 26, went down in agony after his leg was caught in a ruck against Italy and he was taken off the pitch on a stretcher.
Webb has had surgery on his damaged foot but the injury was so serious he will also miss the 2016 Six Nations.
""It hit me straight away, I was an emotional wreck as soon as it happened to a couple of days after,"" Webb said.
""I still think to myself now: 'How am I here and the boys are playing?' But I'm back driving, back in the gym now.
""The amount of pain I was in I knew straight away that my World Cup was over.
""I'd worked so hard over the last two years, with my goal getting that number nine shirt and obviously another one was playing in the World Cup in this country.
""Seeing that go out the window by one freak accident, I was pretty heart-broken.""
Wales' opening wins over Uruguay and England have put them in a strong position to reach the quarter-finals - and Webb says he has been cheered by those victories.
Last season's Pro12 player of the year has now set himself the target of selection for the 2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand.
""I've picked myself up slowly seeing the boys win like they have done and playing well - it's just looking forward now.
""My long-term goal is British Lions - that's everybody's dream - but I need to set some shorter goals so I'll do them in a couple of weeks maybe.""
Webb was back among his Wales team-mates on Wednesday as he and fellow injury absentee Leigh Halfpenny - the full-back ruled out of the World Cup and Six Nations with a knee injury suffered in the same game - presented the match jerseys for Thursday's game against Fiji.
""It was obviously a special occasion,"" Webb added. ""I gave a bit of a speech, which was nerve-wracking, but it was very good, I enjoyed it - I was more nervous presenting the shirts than playing.

- Webb was devastated to miss the World Cup, which was being held in his home country, after working hard to secure the starting number 9 shirt for Wales. 

- Despite the disappointment, Webb has been encouraged by Wales' strong start to the World Cup, with wins over Uruguay and England.

- Webb's long-term goal is to be selected for the 2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. In the meantime, he is focusing on shorter-term recovery goals.

- Webb was back with the Wales team on Wednesday, presenting match jerseys to teammates Dan Lydiate and Taulupe Faletau as they earned their 50th caps.

Rhys Webb, the 26-year-old Ospreys scrum-half, suffered a serious foot injury during a match against Italy that required surgery. The injury has ruled him out of both the World Cup and the 2016 Six Nations.

Webb described being ""an emotional wreck"" immediately after the injury, realizing instantly that his World Cup dreams were over. He expressed heartbreak at seeing his hard work over two years disappear due to ""one freak accident.""

Despite his disappointment, Webb is making progress in his recovery - he's back driving and working in the gym. He's been encouraged by Wales' opening wins against Uruguay and England in the tournament.

Looking forward, Webb has set the 2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand as his long-term goal, though he plans to establish shorter-term targets as well.

Recently, Webb and fellow injured player Leigh Halfpenny presented the match jerseys for Wales' game against Fiji, with Webb describing the experience as more nerve-wracking than playing.",514,240,754,25,0.5,0.5,Question,Correct Answers,document,0.0,0.0,0.6159264895486393,0.6604285277890923,0.6619988459920372

"It raises questions about the conduct of one of the UK's second biggest firearms unit at a time when Manchester has recently been hit by a terror attack.
A public inquiry into one of the deaths has heard about flawed intelligence, a senior officer destroying notes and employment of an officer disciplined for assault.
Its former head of training, John Foxcroft, said he left the firearms unit due to its ""aggressive"" tactics.
Many of the officers in the cases are still serving.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said its firearms officers ""volunteer for the role and do a very difficult job, quite rightly under the highest levels of scrutiny"".
Here is the story of the three fatal incidents, with new findings uncovered by the Victoria Derbyshire programme's investigation.
""He was a beautiful person inside and out,"" Anthony Grainger's partner Gail says.
The couple lived together with their two young children.
""I remember thinking, 'My life's perfect.' Then he nipped out - and he didn't come home.""
Anthony Grainger was unarmed in a car when he was shot by police in Cheshire, in March 2012.
Police intelligence had suggested he was going to carry out an armed robbery with two associates, also in the car.
Mr Grainger had previously been found guilty of handling stolen cars, but had no convictions for violence.
The two other men did have convictions for violence. Police saw one as very dangerous.
Mr Grainger was killed in a car park on a busy Saturday evening in the village of Culcheth.
Armed officers said they saw him drop his hands in a move interpreted as him going to grab a gun - he was shot once, fatally.
But another man in the car, David Totton, told the inquiry no warning was given before the shot was fired.
All three men in the car were unarmed.
On the day of the operation, the firearms team had been on duty for 14 hours when it was told to move in.
There were 16 firearms officers. Several had failed training courses and it was argued during the public inquiry they should not have been on the operation, which Greater Manchester Police disputed.
One officer, known as X7 - who had directed the operation on the ground - had failed a firearms course with the Met Police, who removed him early as his performance was ""adversely affecting other students.""
Another, known as Z15, had failed a safety course shortly before the operation after three extreme safety breaches in potentially life-threatening situations.
A firearms expert told the inquiry these were so ""fundamental and inherently dangerous"" that it should have led to Z15's ""immediate suspension"".
Martin Harding, a former superintendent and firearms officer with Greater Manchester Police, told the BBC: ""A force such as Manchester has got resilience, so there shouldn't be a reason why you would have someone on a job who wasn't trained to carry out their role.""
It emerged during the public inquiry that the officer who fired the gun - referred to as Q9 - had seriously injured a suspect during a previous arrest.
He had also been disciplined for assaulting two people. He was cleared of 10 other separate assault allegations - and remained a firearms officer.
This was not the last serious case Q9 was involved in, we have discovered there was another incident where his conduct was called into question.
All the firearms officers in the Grainger case were granted anonymity so will not talk about this other incident in detail.
Questions over Mr Grainger's death go right to the top of Greater Manchester Police.
During the public inquiry, an assistant chief constable apologised for changing his record of the operation leading up to Anthony Grainger's death, and it was discovered the head of the firearms unit had destroyed his notes when he retired - a year after the shooting.
The police watchdog has launched a new investigation into the case.
It is the second time the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has looked into the case - which is extremely rare. It told us it is examining evidence given at the public inquiry.
Ian Terry was a firearms officer with Greater Manchester Police.
In 2008, during a practice exercise at a disused factory, he volunteered to play the role of a criminal fleeing in a car.
Unusually, the decision - made just that morning - had been taken to use live rounds to make the exercise more realistic.
Mr Terry was shot by an officer using a shotgun loaded with a so-called Rip round cartridge - deadly at close range. He died within minutes.
The father-of-two was not wearing body armour.
His father, Roy Terry, said the family were told ""he had been involved in an accident at work"".
""We were allowed to believe it was some horrendous accident initially, which in the end it transpired it wasn't really.""
The IPCC was scathing, calling the case ""a shocking wake-up call for Greater Manchester Police firearms unit"".
An inquest jury in 2010 ruled Ian Terry had been unlawfully killed and that he ""would have been saved"" if the training had been properly prepared.
His father Roy Terry said the exercise had been made ""too dangerous"".
""We got the impression that the firearms officers were more or less allowed just to get on and do their own thing,"" he added.
John Foxcroft, who ran the firearms training unit at Greater Manchester Police until 2006, before retiring in 2008, told the programme he left the position believing that the force was ""getting a little bit too much into the aggressive tactics"".
""The more aggressive you get, the more likely you are to have people shot.""
The Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges against any officers but Greater Manchester Police was fined for health and safety offences.
In 2014, one of the officers who organised the training was fired from the force.
The man who shot Ian Terry was disciplined but still works for the police.
Roy Terry said this was ""not totally satisfactory, but all we were going to get"".
The BBC has now discovered there is a new investigation by the IPCC into the case, nine years after Ian Terry was killed.
The police watchdog said it has started an investigation looking at evidence given by a number of officers to the IPCC, to the inquest into PC Terry's death, and to a subsequent Health and Safety Executive (HSE) crown court trial.
GMP's Det Ch Supt Paul Rumney said the force ""will consider any recommendations made"" by the the public inquiry.
Jordan Begley was 23. He worked in an ice-cream factory near his home in Gorton in Manchester.
On the night of his death, in July 2013, he had been involved in a drunken argument with his neighbours, and was threatening to attack them with a knife. His mother called the police.
""I need the police here. You need to get the police here. Jordan stay here, you're not going out,"" she can be heard saying in the recorded 999 call.
A patrol officer calmed him down - then other officers arrived, 11 in total, including armed police.
Mr Begley was Tasered and restrained by armed officers. He was punched while he was on the ground and died from heart failure.
""It was a shock. They didn't need that many officers for one person. He was harmless,"" his cousin Conor Turner explained.
At a 2015 inquest the jury found police failings played a part in his death and said he had been unlawfully killed.
It said the force ""inappropriately and unreasonably"" used the Taser for longer than was necessary, once he was on the floor,+ the firearms officers did not try to establish whether he was conscious, and that during restraint Mr Begley ""offered minimal resistance"" with ""no need"" to punch him twice.
The police were initially cleared of any blame but after the inquest the police watchdog quashed its first report and started a new investigation - which had never been done before.

"It raises questions about the conduct of one of the UK's second biggest firearms unit at a time when Manchester has recently been hit by a terror attack.
A public inquiry into one of the deaths has heard about flawed intelligence, a senior officer destroying notes and employment of an officer disciplined for assault.
Its former head of training, John Foxcroft, said he left the firearms unit due to its ""aggressive"" tactics.
Many of the officers in the cases are still serving.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said its firearms officers ""volunteer for the role and do a very difficult job, quite rightly under the highest levels of scrutiny"".
Here is the story of the three fatal incidents, with new findings uncovered by the Victoria Derbyshire programme's investigation.
""He was a beautiful person inside and out,"" Anthony Grainger's partner Gail says.
The couple lived together with their two young children.
""I remember thinking, 'My life's perfect.' Then he nipped out - and he didn't come home.""
Anthony Grainger was unarmed in a car when he was shot by police in Cheshire, in March 2012.
Police intelligence had suggested he was going to carry out an armed robbery with two associates, also in the car.
Mr Grainger had previously been found guilty of handling stolen cars, but had no convictions for violence.
The two other men did have convictions for violence. Police saw one as very dangerous.
Mr Grainger was killed in a car park on a busy Saturday evening in the village of Culcheth.
Armed officers said they saw him drop his hands in a move interpreted as him going to grab a gun - he was shot once, fatally.
But another man in the car, David Totton, told the inquiry no warning was given before the shot was fired.
All three men in the car were unarmed.
On the day of the operation, the firearms team had been on duty for 14 hours when it was told to move in.
There were 16 firearms officers. Several had failed training courses and it was argued during the public inquiry they should not have been on the operation, which Greater Manchester Police disputed.
One officer, known as X7 - who had directed the operation on the ground - had failed a firearms course with the Met Police, who removed him early as his performance was ""adversely affecting other students.""
Another, known as Z15, had failed a safety course shortly before the operation after three extreme safety breaches in potentially life-threatening situations.
A firearms expert told the inquiry these were so ""fundamental and inherently dangerous"" that it should have led to Z15's ""immediate suspension"".
Martin Harding, a former superintendent and firearms officer with Greater Manchester Police, told the BBC: ""A force such as Manchester has got resilience, so there shouldn't be a reason why you would have someone on a job who wasn't trained to carry out their role.""
It emerged during the public inquiry that the officer who fired the gun - referred to as Q9 - had seriously injured a suspect during a previous arrest.
He had also been disciplined for assaulting two people. He was cleared of 10 other separate assault allegations - and remained a firearms officer.
This was not the last serious case Q9 was involved in, we have discovered there was another incident where his conduct was called into question.
All the firearms officers in the Grainger case were granted anonymity so will not talk about this other incident in detail.
Questions over Mr Grainger's death go right to the top of Greater Manchester Police.
During the public inquiry, an assistant chief constable apologised for changing his record of the operation leading up to Anthony Grainger's death, and it was discovered the head of the firearms unit had destroyed his notes when he retired - a year after the shooting.
The police watchdog has launched a new investigation into the case.
It is the second time the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has looked into the case - which is extremely rare. It told us it is examining evidence given at the public inquiry.
Ian Terry was a firearms officer with Greater Manchester Police.
In 2008, during a practice exercise at a disused factory, he volunteered to play the role of a criminal fleeing in a car.
Unusually, the decision - made just that morning - had been taken to use live rounds to make the exercise more realistic.
Mr Terry was shot by an officer using a shotgun loaded with a so-called Rip round cartridge - deadly at close range. He died within minutes.
The father-of-two was not wearing body armour.
His father, Roy Terry, said the family were told ""he had been involved in an accident at work"".
""We were allowed to believe it was some horrendous accident initially, which in the end it transpired it wasn't really.""
The IPCC was scathing, calling the case ""a shocking wake-up call for Greater Manchester Police firearms unit"".
An inquest jury in 2010 ruled Ian Terry had been unlawfully killed and that he ""would have been saved"" if the training had been properly prepared.
His father Roy Terry said the exercise had been made ""too dangerous"".
""We got the impression that the firearms officers were more or less allowed just to get on and do their own thing,"" he added.
John Foxcroft, who ran the firearms training unit at Greater Manchester Police until 2006, before retiring in 2008, told the programme he left the position believing that the force was ""getting a little bit too much into the aggressive tactics"".
""The more aggressive you get, the more likely you are to have people shot.""
The Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges against any officers but Greater Manchester Police was fined for health and safety offences.
In 2014, one of the officers who organised the training was fired from the force.
The man who shot Ian Terry was disciplined but still works for the police.
Roy Terry said this was ""not totally satisfactory, but all we were going to get"".
The BBC has now discovered there is a new investigation by the IPCC into the case, nine years after Ian Terry was killed.
The police watchdog said it has started an investigation looking at evidence given by a number of officers to the IPCC, to the inquest into PC Terry's death, and to a subsequent Health and Safety Executive (HSE) crown court trial.
GMP's Det Ch Supt Paul Rumney said the force ""will consider any recommendations made"" by the the public inquiry.
Jordan Begley was 23. He worked in an ice-cream factory near his home in Gorton in Manchester.
On the night of his death, in July 2013, he had been involved in a drunken argument with his neighbours, and was threatening to attack them with a knife. His mother called the police.
""I need the police here. You need to get the police here. Jordan stay here, you're not going out,"" she can be heard saying in the recorded 999 call.
A patrol officer calmed him down - then other officers arrived, 11 in total, including armed police.
Mr Begley was Tasered and restrained by armed officers. He was punched while he was on the ground and died from heart failure.
""It was a shock. They didn't need that many officers for one person. He was harmless,"" his cousin Conor Turner explained.
At a 2015 inquest the jury found police failings played a part in his death and said he had been unlawfully killed.
It said the force ""inappropriately and unreasonably"" used the Taser for longer than was necessary, once he was on the floor,+ the firearms officers did not try to establish whether he was conscious, and that during restraint Mr Begley ""offered minimal resistance"" with ""no need"" to punch him twice.
The police were initially cleared of any blame but after the inquest the police watchdog quashed its first report and started a new investigation - which had never been done before.

- It details three cases where people were fatally shot or restrained by GMP firearms officers between 2008-2013 - Anthony Grainger, Ian Terry, and Jordan Begley. 

- In the Grainger case, there were issues around flawed intelligence, officers failing training courses, a senior officer destroying notes, and the officer who fired having previously assaulted people.

- Terry was killed in 2008 during a firearms training exercise that used live ammunition unnecessarily, leading to GMP being fined.

- Begley died in 2013 after being punched and restrained by armed officers called to a domestic incident, in a case ruled an unlawful killing.

- The police watchdog (IPCC) has launched new investigations into the Grainger and Terry cases years later, which is highly unusual.

- Despite the controversies, many of the officers involved in these fatal incidents remain serving with GMP's firearms unit.

The Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges against any officers but Greater Manchester Police was fined for health and safety offences.
In 2014, one of the officers who organised the training was fired from the force.
The man who shot Ian Terry was disciplined but still works for the police.
Roy Terry said this was ""not totally satisfactory, but all we were going to get"".
The BBC has now discovered there is a new investigation by the IPCC into the case, nine years after Ian Terry was killed.
The police watchdog said it has started an investigation looking at evidence given by a number of officers to the IPCC, to the inquest into PC Terry's death, and to a subsequent Health and Safety Executive (HSE) crown court trial.
GMP's Det Ch Supt Paul Rumney said the force ""will consider any recommendations made"" by the the public inquiry.
Jordan Begley was 23. He worked in an ice-cream factory near his home in Gorton in Manchester.
On the night of his death, in July 2013, he had been involved in a drunken argument with his neighbours, and was threatening to attack them with a knife. His mother called the police.
""I need the police here. You need to get the police here. Jordan stay here, you're not going out,"" she can be heard saying in the recorded 999 call.
A patrol officer calmed him down - then other officers arrived, 11 in total, including armed police.
Mr Begley was Tasered and restrained by armed officers. He was punched while he was on the ground and died from heart failure.
""It was a shock. They didn't need that many officers for one person. He was harmless,"" his cousin Conor Turner explained.
At a 2015 inquest the jury found police failings played a part in his death and said he had been unlawfully killed.
It said the force ""inappropriately and unreasonably"" used the Taser for longer than was necessary, once he was on the floor,+ the firearms officers did not try to establish whether he was conscious, and that during restraint Mr Begley ""offered minimal resistance"" with ""no need"" to punch him twice.
The police were initially cleared of any blame but after the inquest the police watchdog quashed its first report and started a new investigation - which had never been done before.

"It raises questions about the conduct of one of the UK's second biggest firearms unit at a time when Manchester has recently been hit by a terror attack.
A public inquiry into one of the deaths has heard about flawed intelligence, a senior officer destroying notes and employment of an officer disciplined for assault.
Its former head of training, John Foxcroft, said he left the firearms unit due to its ""aggressive"" tactics.
Many of the officers in the cases are still serving.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said its firearms officers ""volunteer for the role and do a very difficult job, quite rightly under the highest levels of scrutiny"".
Here is the story of the three fatal incidents, with new findings uncovered by the Victoria Derbyshire programme's investigation.
""He was a beautiful person inside and out,"" Anthony Grainger's partner Gail says.
The couple lived together with their two young children.
""I remember thinking, 'My life's perfect.' Then he nipped out - and he didn't come home.""
Anthony Grainger was unarmed in a car when he was shot by police in Cheshire, in March 2012.
Police intelligence had suggested he was going to carry out an armed robbery with two associates, also in the car.
Mr Grainger had previously been found guilty of handling stolen cars, but had no convictions for violence.
The two other men did have convictions for violence. Police saw one as very dangerous.
Mr Grainger was killed in a car park on a busy Saturday evening in the village of Culcheth.
Armed officers said they saw him drop his hands in a move interpreted as him going to grab a gun - he was shot once, fatally.
But another man in the car, David Totton, told the inquiry no warning was given before the shot was fired.
All three men in the car were unarmed.
On the day of the operation, the firearms team had been on duty for 14 hours when it was told to move in.
There were 16 firearms officers. Several had failed training courses and it was argued during the public inquiry they should not have been on the operation, which Greater Manchester Police disputed.
One officer, known as X7 - who had directed the operation on the ground - had failed a firearms course with the Met Police, who removed him early as his performance was ""adversely affecting other students.""
Another, known as Z15, had failed a safety course shortly before the operation after three extreme safety breaches in potentially life-threatening situations.
A firearms expert told the inquiry these were so ""fundamental and inherently dangerous"" that it should have led to Z15's ""immediate suspension"".
Martin Harding, a former superintendent and firearms officer with Greater Manchester Police, told the BBC: ""A force such as Manchester has got resilience, so there shouldn't be a reason why you would have someone on a job who wasn't trained to carry out their role.""
It emerged during the public inquiry that the officer who fired the gun - referred to as Q9 - had seriously injured a suspect during a previous arrest.
He had also been disciplined for assaulting two people. He was cleared of 10 other separate assault allegations - and remained a firearms officer.
This was not the last serious case Q9 was involved in, we have discovered there was another incident where his conduct was called into question.
All the firearms officers in the Grainger case were granted anonymity so will not talk about this other incident in detail.
Questions over Mr Grainger's death go right to the top of Greater Manchester Police.
During the public inquiry, an assistant chief constable apologised for changing his record of the operation leading up to Anthony Grainger's death, and it was discovered the head of the firearms unit had destroyed his notes when he retired - a year after the shooting.
The police watchdog has launched a new investigation into the case.
It is the second time the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has looked into the case - which is extremely rare. It told us it is examining evidence given at the public inquiry.
Ian Terry was a firearms officer with Greater Manchester Police.
In 2008, during a practice exercise at a disused factory, he volunteered to play the role of a criminal fleeing in a car.
Unusually, the decision - made just that morning - had been taken to use live rounds to make the exercise more realistic.
Mr Terry was shot by an officer using a shotgun loaded with a so-called Rip round cartridge - deadly at close range. He died within minutes.
The father-of-two was not wearing body armour.
His father, Roy Terry, said the family were told ""he had been involved in an accident at work"".
""We were allowed to believe it was some horrendous accident initially, which in the end it transpired it wasn't really.""
The IPCC was scathing, calling the case ""a shocking wake-up call for Greater Manchester Police firearms unit"".
An inquest jury in 2010 ruled Ian Terry had been unlawfully killed and that he ""would have been saved"" if the training had been properly prepared.
His father Roy Terry said the exercise had been made ""too dangerous"".
""We got the impression that the firearms officers were more or less allowed just to get on and do their own thing,"" he added.
John Foxcroft, who ran the firearms training unit at Greater Manchester Police until 2006, before retiring in 2008, told the programme he left the position believing that the force was ""getting a little bit too much into the aggressive tactics"".
""The more aggressive you get, the more likely you are to have people shot.""
The Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges against any officers but Greater Manchester Police was fined for health and safety offences.
In 2014, one of the officers who organised the training was fired from the force.

"The problem affects voice-over-internet-protocol (Voip) phones, commonly installed by businesses, when default passwords are used.
Snom, the manufacturer whose phones were used in the research, has said the attack affects outdated software.
A spokesman said the tested firmware was ""never in wide circulation"".
The researcher carried out tests on a phone that was reset to ""default"" factory settings.
Just by running a couple of lines of code on a website visited by the phone user, the researchers demonstrated how premium-rate calls could be made.
By exploiting the fact that Voip phones and desktop computers are connected to the same internet network at many organisations, attackers are often able to access the phones themselves and operate them without the owner becoming aware.
""It's incredibly easy to do,"" said security researcher Per Thorsheim, who was involved in the demonstration by fellow researcher Paul Moore.
However, a spokesman for Snom said, ""Snom's internal investigation reveals that the desktop telephone used in Mr Paul Moore's experiment was an old 2008 telephone model utilizing outdated beta firmware... which was never in wide circulation.
""The latest and current firmware is version 8.7.5.35 and there have been multiple firmware releases since the outdated beta release.""
The spokesman added that Snom telephones by default request that both users and network administrators set a password during installation.
""If a password is not set, a continuous non-stop, endless visual warning on the device's display is illuminated,"" he said.
Mr Thorsheim explained that the tested phone could be compromised if the user visited a web page containing a couple of lines of Javascript web code.
Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at the University of Surrey, said attacks on Voip phones were a ""significant problem"" and pointed out that by using online tools he was able to find many examples of phones that could be accessed using the method.
""The one we do know where it's being used a lot is premium-rate scams,"" he told the BBC.
""They use your phone to dial a premium-rate number. There's a lot of that going on - we're talking millions being made out of that.""
The practice of using phone lines paid for by companies to make expensive calls for little or no fee is thought to be increasingly common, according to research by security consultancy Nettitude.
In a report last year, it said that the UK was particularly badly affected.
Prof Woodward said the issue was similar to flaws found in internet-connected devices and warned that with the rise of the Internet of Things, similar tricks were likely to become more and more common.
""It's a huge wake-up call to anybody who's building devices with embedded software,"" he said.",Security researchers have hacked a phone to show how it is possible to eavesdrop on conversations and make premium calls on someone else's line.,35579273,Claude 3 Haiku,anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0,"Here is a summary of the key points:

"The Ocean's Eleven stars will premiere '50s-set crime comedy Suburbicon at the event, which Damon stars in and Clooney co-writes and directs.
Damon will also be seen in festival opener Downsizing, directed by Alexander Payne.
After premiering three major Academy Award winners in a row, Venice is seen as a good luck charm for the Oscars.
Previous films to debut at the event include Birdman and Spotlight, which went on to win the Academy Award for best picture.
Last year's opener La La Land was also named best picture - but only as the result of an envelope mix-up.
In Suburbicon, Damon character tries to understand the dark mysteries of his seemingly peaceful town along with wife Margaret, played by Julianne Moore.
In Downsizing, which also stars Kristen Wiig, Neil Patrick Harris and Jason Sudeikis, he plays a man who literally shrinks himself in search of a better life.
Guillermo Del Toro will debut his other-worldly fairy-tale The Shape of Water. Set against the backdrop of America's Cold War era, it stars Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon and Octavia Spencer.
Darren Aronofsky will also premiere his latest film Mother!, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem.
The director said he was ""excited"" to be unveiling the horror film, which will also screen at Toronto.
Chinese contemporary artist and activist Ai Weiwei will also be competing in the festival with his film Human Flow, a film about the global refugee crisis.
Spanning 23 countries over the course of a year, the film focuses on both the scale of the crisis and its personal human impact.
Weiwei said: ""There is no refugee crisis, only a human crisis. The border is not at Lesbos, but really it is in our hearts and minds.""
Jane Fonda and Robert Redford will be celebrated with the Golden Lion lifetime achievement award at the festival.
Netflix film Our Souls at Night, in which they both star, will be premiered out of competition.
Alberto Barbera, the festival's artistic director, called Fonda ""one of the great protagonists of contemporary international cinema"" and Redford ""a thoughtful, instinctive actor with a keen sense of detail.""
New to this year's festivities is Venice Virtual Reality, billed as the first competition for VR works at a major film festival.
The 74th edition of the Venice Film Festival runs from 30 August to 5 September.

Three years ago that person was Jonjoe, but after his mum persuaded him to go on a Snow-Camp ski course, everything changed.
""I was worried because I felt he just didn't know where he was going,"" said Debby. ""I never dreamed this would come out of that moment.""
I love the way Snow-Camp uses my sport to support young people who wouldn't ever get the chance to get involved in snow sports
The thrill of taking part in snow sports often attracts young people but the associated costs can mean it is an experience only available to the privileged and wealthy.
UK charity Snow-Camp works in deprived inner-city areas to use young people's interest in the sports to engage them and provide life skills, qualifications and vocational training.
""I was a perfect candidate for it,"" says Jonjoe, who comes from Hackney Wick in London. ""I'd never seen snow before, crazily! And never ever thought I'd put skis on.""
Jonjoe progressed through the charity's programmes and last year was offered a year's paid apprenticeship in the snow sports industry.
""Through the apprenticeship I'm now an internationally-qualified ski coach and working my way up. Just through that one day of saying 'You know what mum, maybe I am going to go...', it's completely changed my life.""

In 2014, Sami had dropped out of school and was often in trouble with the police. He lacked confidence and was facing a future that involved gangs, crime and continued unemployment.
""I was easily influenced and vulnerable to bad decisions. I had an attitude and I wasn't the best with authority,"" he said.
Snowboarding has already inspired me to improve my life and I want to use it to have a positive impact on others.
""I didn't know what I wanted to do as I had been through so much and let it drag me to the lowest of the low.""
He turned to the youth club Ladbroke Grove for support who enrolled him on to Snow-Camp's programmes, and over the next year progressed to gain a Snowsport England Level 1 Snowboarding Instructor qualification.
""I never knew I wanted to snowboard for the rest of my life,"" Sami added. ""That's because I didn't want to because it's a sport that people like me don't even consider.
""Snow-Camp has had a big effect on my personal life. I now feel like I can do something valuable and worthwhile with my time.
""My dream is to become a full-time snowboard instructor. Snowboarding has already inspired me to improve my life and I want to use it to have a positive impact on others.""
Like many boys of his age, 13-year-old Hamza didn't enjoy school; he was often getting into trouble and had no aspirations for his future.
His family were worried he may get involved with gangs and would struggle to gain any GCSEs so Hamza's youth worker got in touch with Snow-Camp.
Hamza connected to snow sports immediately and was willing to work hard in classroom activities just to be able to strap on a snowboard.
Hamza said: ""Before Snow-Camp I didn't enjoy school... I did not think that I would enjoy snow sports or want to work hard in a classroom, but with Snow-Camp I do both of these things.""
Like Jonjoe and Sami, Hamza completed the programme of training which led to him being awarded one of the charity's apprenticeships.
""I'm inspired to become a full-time snowboard and ski instructor, showing others the skills that can be learnt through these amazing sports,"" he said.
""I want to show young people from estates like mine that they too can become snowboard and ski instructors.""
When Hamza finishes his apprenticeship in June 2017, his future is looking bright.
At the end of Snow-Camp's 2015 programme year, 85% of young people who completed their Journey of Programmes went on to either employment, training or further education.
To date, 90% of Snow-Camp apprentices gain a full-time job in the snow sports industry at the end of their apprenticeship.
Snow-Camp works directly with youth projects and youth service providers to find participants who are most in need of support.
The programmes are operated at indoor and artificial slopes in the UK:
The charity runs a full range of programmes for young people aged 13-21, taking them from their first experience of snowboarding or skiing, through to instructor training for the over-16s and, for five students a year, a paid full-time apprenticeship.
For every hour the trainees spend learning how to ski or snowboard, the same amount of time is spent in the classroom.
""When you look inside Snow-Camp's programmes, they train an individual to be able to control certain aspects of behaviour, to channel negative energy into positive energy and create the overall outcome of someone who could work in the same industry as me,"" said Warren Smith, international free skier and ambassador for the charity.
Sir Steve Redgrave is another supporter: ""Snow-Camp is a fantastic charity helping those from deprived backgrounds do something positive.

The article highlights how Snow-Camp, a UK charity, uses snow sports to engage young people from deprived inner-city areas, providing them with life skills, qualifications, and vocational training.

Three success stories are featured:

1. **Jonjoe from Hackney Wick**: Initially directionless, he joined Snow-Camp at his mother's urging and is now an internationally-qualified ski coach through the charity's apprenticeship program.

2. **Sami**: Previously a school dropout with police troubles, he discovered snowboarding through Snow-Camp and gained a Snowsport England Level 1 Instructor qualification, finding purpose and direction.

3. **Hamza**: A 13-year-old struggling in school who found motivation through snowboarding and is now working toward becoming an instructor.

The charity's impact is significant:
- 85% of program graduates move on to employment, training, or further education
- 90% of apprentices secure full-time jobs in the snow sports industry

Like many boys of his age, 13-year-old Hamza didn't enjoy school; he was often getting into trouble and had no aspirations for his future.
His family were worried he may get involved with gangs and would struggle to gain any GCSEs so Hamza's youth worker got in touch with Snow-Camp.
Hamza connected to snow sports immediately and was willing to work hard in classroom activities just to be able to strap on a snowboard.
Hamza said: ""Before Snow-Camp I didn't enjoy school... I did not think that I would enjoy snow sports or want to work hard in a classroom, but with Snow-Camp I do both of these things.""
Like Jonjoe and Sami, Hamza completed the programme of training which led to him being awarded one of the charity's apprenticeships.
""I'm inspired to become a full-time snowboard and ski instructor, showing others the skills that can be learnt through these amazing sports,"" he said.
""I want to show young people from estates like mine that they too can become snowboard and ski instructors.""
When Hamza finishes his apprenticeship in June 2017, his future is looking bright.
At the end of Snow-Camp's 2015 programme year, 85% of young people who completed their Journey of Programmes went on to either employment, training or further education.
To date, 90% of Snow-Camp apprentices gain a full-time job in the snow sports industry at the end of their apprenticeship.
Snow-Camp works directly with youth projects and youth service providers to find participants who are most in need of support.
The programmes are operated at indoor and artificial slopes in the UK:
The charity runs a full range of programmes for young people aged 13-21, taking them from their first experience of snowboarding or skiing, through to instructor training for the over-16s and, for five students a year, a paid full-time apprenticeship.
For every hour the trainees spend learning how to ski or snowboard, the same amount of time is spent in the classroom.
""When you look inside Snow-Camp's programmes, they train an individual to be able to control certain aspects of behaviour, to channel negative energy into positive energy and create the overall outcome of someone who could work in the same industry as me,"" said Warren Smith, international free skier and ambassador for the charity.
Sir Steve Redgrave is another supporter: ""Snow-Camp is a fantastic charity helping those from deprived backgrounds do something positive.

Sami, who had dropped out of school and was involved with gangs, was enrolled in Snow-Camp's programs by his youth club. He gained a Snowsport England Level 1 Snowboarding Instructor qualification and now wants to become a full-time snowboard instructor to have a positive impact on others.

Scottish Natural Heritage said Scotland had a low percentage of woodland cover compared with other European countries.
A commitment to plant 10,000 extra hectares of trees between now and 2022 was made in the government's draft Climate Plan.
But, in an unusual alliance, Mountaineering Scotland and the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA), said they were concerned about the impact of the Scottish government's forestry targets on wild moorland.
The letter states: ""Our concern is whether adequate weight is being given to the significant changes this will have on the landscape of Scotland and in particular the dramatic open views and vistas which have come to signify to the outside world that which is unique about our country.
""Until a vision and strategy for Scotland's uplands is in place, there is an obvious failure to join up what is required from the land to meet forestry targets and what we might want to keep in terms of internationally rare and valuable landscapes and ecosystems.""
The two organisations are calling for an urgent policy statement which protects moorlands.
Neil Reid, from Mountaineering Scotland, told BBC Scotland: ""It is a serious issue for both of us and that's why we have come together in this way.
""There are many things we do disagree about, and will continue to disagree about, but the key thing is that we both need a coherent policy and an overall vision for the landscape of Scotland.""
The group, which represents hill walkers and mountaineers, wants moorland areas to be left untouched as a wild landscape for tourists.
Those tourists, they argue, are an important contributor to the local economy.

""You can see the hills around you, you see the shape of the landscape and it's also relatively benign for walking across.""
The two groups have invited the Scottish government to share its thinking on the relative value placed on woodland and moorland.
Gamekeeper Bob Connelly said: ""Heather heathland is one of the rarer types of habitat in the world.
""We, in Britain, have a very large percentage of it and to cover it in trees is just ecological vandalism.""
Both groups emphasise that they are not opposed to tree planting but that sites have to be well chosen.
Ecologist Dr James Fenton, who has written a document called ""A Future for Moorland in Scotland"" for the SGA, has echoed the calls for moorland protection.

A commitment to plant 10,000 extra hectares of trees between now and 2022 was made in the government's draft Climate Plan.
But, in an unusual alliance, Mountaineering Scotland and the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA), said they were concerned about the impact of the Scottish government's forestry targets on wild moorland.
The letter states: ""Our concern is whether adequate weight is being given to the significant changes this will have on the landscape of Scotland and in particular the dramatic open views and vistas which have come to signify to the outside world that which is unique about our country.
""Until a vision and strategy for Scotland's uplands is in place, there is an obvious failure to join up what is required from the land to meet forestry targets and what we might want to keep in terms of internationally rare and valuable landscapes and ecosystems.""
The two organisations are calling for an urgent policy statement which protects moorlands.
Neil Reid, from Mountaineering Scotland, told BBC Scotland: ""It is a serious issue for both of us and that's why we have come together in this way.
""There are many things we do disagree about, and will continue to disagree about, but the key thing is that we both need a coherent policy and an overall vision for the landscape of Scotland.""
The group, which represents hill walkers and mountaineers, wants moorland areas to be left untouched as a wild landscape for tourists.
Those tourists, they argue, are an important contributor to the local economy.
Mr Reid added: ""They talk about this landscape, they don't talk about going for miles long wanders through woods.
""You can see the hills around you, you see the shape of the landscape and it's also relatively benign for walking across.""
The two groups have invited the Scottish government to share its thinking on the relative value placed on woodland and moorland.
Gamekeeper Bob Connelly said: ""Heather heathland is one of the rarer types of habitat in the world.
""We, in Britain, have a very large percentage of it and to cover it in trees is just ecological vandalism.""
Both groups emphasise that they are not opposed to tree planting but that sites have to be well chosen.
Ecologist Dr James Fenton, who has written a document called ""A Future for Moorland in Scotland"" for the SGA, has echoed the calls for moorland protection.
He said: ""It's disparaged rather than being recognised as important so they'd be quite happy to get rid of our finest landscape.
""[We would] lose them by attrition, one bit is lost to trees here or a dam there or a wind farm there and we are just losing our wild, wide open spaces which characterise Scotland, and that concerns me.""
Stuart Goodall, from the forestry body Confer, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""When we are creating woodland, it's not just about how can we pack in as many trees as we can in a block.
""It's about how do we design that new woodland into the landscape, how do we create opportunities for wildlife.""

"Footage shows two men accosting Vuyo Mvoko, from the national broadcaster SABC, who was outside a Johannesburg hospital to report on the arrival of Zambia's president for medical tests.
Mr Mvoko later said one of the muggers threatened him with a gun when he did not want to give up his mobile phone.
The robbers appear unconcerned by the presence of the camera.
Shortly afterwards, Mr Mvoko, who is a contributing editor for the national news channel, tweeted that he was safe and sound and posted a link to a video of the mugging, which has gone viral.
Police said the robbers took laptops and mobile phones and that officers were investigating in the incident.
""Hopefully someone will be able to identify them and get them arrested,"" Mr Mvoko told the BBC's Newsday programme.
He said it took him a while to realise what was happening as it was less than a minute till he was due to go live near the Milpark Hospital.
""I couldn't understand why they'd walk right in front of the camera because the light is on and they could see that - and our car is branded, so they could see that this is a live broadcast.""
The thieves told him to hand over his phone, which he said was in his hand.
""Because I wasn't giving him the phone, he then called the other one who had a gun, and said: 'Dubula le nja' [Shoot this dog],"" Mr Mvoko told SABC.
At this point he said another member of the team screamed at him to hand over the phone, which he did.
The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Milpark is a relatively quiet area, not normally associated with crime.
The SA National Editors' Forum (Sanef) has condemned the mugging.
""Every South African lives with the reality of crime, but to see thugs brazenly ignoring television cameras and robbing media workers in the course of their work, yet again brings home the level of criminality in our society,"" a statement from the forum said.

DreamHost views this as a win for internet privacy and appreciates the DoJ reconsidering the broad scope of the original request. However, DreamHost still plans to challenge other aspects of the revised warrant.

The DoJ says the full scope of the original broad warrant was unknown to them initially. The amended warrant still requires files and databases stored by DreamHost related to disruptj20.org.

Here's a summary:

The US Department of Justice (DoJ) had issued a warrant to DreamHost, a web hosting company, to obtain information about the website disruptj20.org, which was used to organize protests during President Trump's inauguration. DreamHost argued that the warrant was too broad and would reveal 1.3 million IP addresses, which would compromise internet privacy. The DoJ has now narrowed the scope of its demand, stating that it is only interested in records related to planning and carrying out a criminal act (a ""riot""), not peaceful protests. The updated warrant no longer requires access and error logs, which means visitors' IP addresses are ""largely safe"". DreamHost considers this a ""huge win for internet privacy"" but still plans to challenge other aspects of the DoJ's request. The DoJ is still seeking files and databases stored by DreamHost, and over 200 people have been charged in relation to rioting at the inauguration.",361,196,557,25,0.5,0.5,Question,Correct Answers,document,,,0.8961359292187734,0.9003077160247237,0.8853906558218994
