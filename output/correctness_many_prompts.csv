- Food has generally become more affordable as a percentage of household income since the 1960s
- Americans now spend a smaller portion of their income on food (about 10-12%) compared to 17-18% in the 1960s

## Key Developments
- Basic staple foods have remained relatively affordable for most Americans
- Grocery prices have experienced significant inflation since 2020, with food-at-home prices rising 20-25% during this period
- Income inequality has created disparate experiences, with lower-income households spending a much higher percentage of their income on food
- Food insecurity affects roughly 10-13% of American households despite overall affordability improvements

This theorem provides the theoretical foundation for the Simplex Method, as it guarantees that when searching for an optimal solution, we only need to examine the vertices of the feasible region (the basic feasible solutions). This dramatically reduces the search space from infinite to finite, making linear programming problems computationally tractable.

The theorem is crucial in applied mathematics, operations research, and engineering optimization because it explains why the Simplex Method works and why we can find optimal solutions by moving from vertex to vertex along the edges of the feasible region.",42,182,224,0,0,200,0.5,0.9,Question,Correct Answers,document,1.0,"The actual output correctly identifies the Fundamental Theorem of Linear Programming, matching the expected output.
